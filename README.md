Hyoleum.exe (For Entertainment and Educational Purposes Only)

Hyoleum is an open-source application built to simulate digital display anomalies and real-time screen glitch art. This repository provides both the visual framework and a pre-compiled demonstration interface.

Features

Dynamic Frame Buffer Rendering: Captures the initial display state and applies programmatic transformations.

Multi-Stage Glitch Modes: Transitions automatically through 4 separate visual phases including color inversion blocks, rotational vortex transformations, screen wrapping, and geometric tunneling.

Custom Cursor Hooking: Unsets the native OS mouse pointer to draw a responsive, dynamic asset (xbutton.png) with persistence caching (cursor trails).

Audio Track Synchronization: Integrates background audio loops synced to shift playback offsets automatically as each visual phase evolves.

Self-Terminating Execution Loop: Includes an automatic safety timer that gracefully exits the main application and restores full system display visibility once the sequence finishes.

Installation and Running the Executable

You can run this project either by compiling the source or using the pre-compiled standalone executable.

Using the Pre-compiled Executable (.exe)

Download the executable from the official Releases section of this repository.

Ensure that your asset files (xbutton.png and background.mp3) are placed in the same folder as the hyoleum.exe.

Launch hyoleum.exe.

Note: Since this application temporarily overlays the screen and alters cursor behavior to simulate a glitch effect, local security software (like Windows Defender) might show a "False Positive" warning. This is expected behavior for screen manipulation tools.

Controls

N Key: Advances the application directly to the next simulation mode / serves as a skip feature.

Auto-Exit: The application will close itself naturally after all defined mode durations conclude.

Disclaimer

This project is intended strictly for entertainment, educational, scientific, and creative digital arts purposes. It acts purely as a temporary overlay simulation interface—it does not alter or modify underlying system files, intercept permanent registry data, or generate network traffic. It is completely safe to run in standard sandbox environments.
